computer sets a code of four colors
user submits a guess of four colors
compare two sets of colors
return input on whether a submitted color was in the right position, or
  if it's just the correct color
quit game at any time
message them about their guess if formatted incorrectly
time the game

display an introductory message
prompt the user for a guess
display message about the user's guess

user wins when both sets of color codes match

classes:

* code maker/checker
 creates the color code
 compares the user's color code
 returns if it is a full, partial, or no match

*timer
 starts when the user enters their first color
 ends when the correct code is guessed

* display
posts introductory message
allows user to see rules
asks user for guess
displays feedback on their guess
tells them when the game is over/reports on their results.



the color sequence generator:
colors = ["R", "G", "B", "Y"]
sequence = []
4.times.each do
  new << array.shuffle.pop
end







code: needs to have four slots, with a color assigned to the position. sounds
like a hash to me.
